        <h2>Some favorite quotes</h2>
	<div id="content">
	  Here are some quotes I've picked up along the way.

<p>

</p><ul>
He chose to be rich, by making his wants few. 
<br>- R.W. Emerson on H.D. Thoreau
<br><br>Make no little plans; they have no magic to stir men's blood. 
<br>- Daniel Hudson Burnham
<br><br>I do not speak with any fondness, but the language of coldest history,
when I say that Boston commands attention as the town which was appointed
in the destiny of nations to lead the civilization of North America.
<br>- R.W. Emerson
<br><br>Luckily in the movies, the Japanese had been issued bullets which
bounced off tall actors running slowly. 
<br>- PBS program narrator on John Wayne as a WWII hero
<br><br>Certain English geologists produced confusion by embracing continental
drift and then drawing up narratives and maps that showed continents
moving all over the earth with respect to a fixed and undriftable
England. 
<br>- John McPhee in 'Basin and Range', concerning the plate tectonics
revolution.
<br><br>Henry Ford, during a tour of a new automated Ford plant with Walter
Reuther (UAW president): ``Well, Walter, how are you going to get
these machines to pay union dues?'' Replied Reuther: ``But Henry,
how are you going to get them to buy cars?'' 
<br>- recounted by Victor Reuther
<br><br>We who lived in concentration camps can remember the men who walked
through the huts comforting others, giving away their last piece of
bread. They may have been few in number, but they offer sufficient
proof that everything can be taken from a man but one thing: the last
of the human freedoms - to choose one's attitude in any given set
of circumstances, to choose one's own way. 
<br>-Viktor Frankl, author, neurologist and psychiatrist, Holocaust survivor
(1905-1997)
<br><br>I know not with what weapons World War III will be fought, but World
War IV will be fought with sticks and stones.
<br>- Albert Einstein
<br><br>I know the pain of being less than equal and I cannot and will not impose that status on anyone else. I was but one generation removed from an existence in slavery. I could not in good conscience ever vote to send anyone to that place from which my family fled.
<br>- Dianne Wilkerson, Massachusetts state senator in opposition to a state constitutional amendment banning gay marriage
<br><br>Never doubt that a small group of dedicated people can change the
world. Indeed, it is the only thing that ever has.
<br>- Barry Bloom's version of a Margaret Mead quote.
